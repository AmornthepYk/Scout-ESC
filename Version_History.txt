0.92.02         03/05/2017 - Changed version to standard nomenclature. 
   9.02         01/20/2017 - Fixed bug in serial checksum validation routine.
   9.01         10/11/2016 - Changed serial watchdog command to be compatible with the Sabertooth protocol. 
                           - Added a serial command to allow changing the baud rate also compatible with the 
                             Sabertooth protocol, but unlike the Sabertooth the Scout will always boot to a 
                             fixed baud of 38400. This makes initial communication with the device easier since 
                             you don't have to guess what baud rate it might be set at.
                           - Enable voltage sensing.
   8.01         07/23/2016 - Overcurrent, overtemp, and over/under voltage fault handing, fan control, 
                             expanded serial commands, serial watchdog, and more.
